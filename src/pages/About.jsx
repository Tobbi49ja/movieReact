        <p className="intro-text">
          Welcome to <strong>TobbiHub</strong> — your ultimate online destination
          for movies, TV shows, and animation, all streamed from reliable sources.
          Our goal is simple: to make entertainment easily accessible, enjoyable,
          and seamless for everyone, everywhere.
        </p>

        <div className="about-section">
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At TobbiHub, we believe movies are more than just visuals — they are
            experiences, emotions, and timeless stories. Whether it’s the joy of a
            well-timed joke, the suspense of a perfect plot twist, or the
            inspiration from a character’s journey, our mission is to keep that
            magic alive by delivering the best cinematic content with simplicity
            and speed. We aim to reduce data consumption without compromising on
            quality, ensuring smooth streaming even on low bandwidth connections.
          </p>

          <h2>How We Started</h2>
          <p>
            TobbiHub began as a small experiment — a passion project built out of
            frustration with cluttered, ad-filled streaming sites. What started as
            a single-page test quickly evolved into a sleek, user-friendly platform
            built with React, speed optimization, and an eye for design. Over time,
            we introduced categories, animations, search filters, and TV series
            integration, all designed to make your viewing experience enjoyable.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Technology</h2>
          <p>
            TobbiHub is powered by modern web technologies — React for frontend
            flexibility, APIs like TMDB for accurate movie data, and multiple
            streaming sources like VidSrc, AutoEmbed, and SmashyStream for backup
            reliability. Each component of our system is fine-tuned to ensure a
            lightweight footprint, meaning faster loading, reduced data usage, and
            smooth navigation even on mid-range devices.
          </p>

          <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional streaming sites, TobbiHub doesn’t bombard users with
            popups or redirects. Instead, our design philosophy is built around
            simplicity and minimalism. No distractions, no clutter — just movies,
            shows, and your pure entertainment. We also respect creators and never
            host any files ourselves; all content is embedded from publicly
            available third-party sources.
          </p>

          <h2>Community and Support</h2>
          <p>
            TobbiHub isn’t just a site; it’s a growing community of movie lovers.
            We thrive on feedback from our users — every suggestion, every comment,
            and every review helps shape how the platform evolves. Soon, users will
            be able to rate movies, leave reactions, and recommend their favorite
            titles directly within the platform. We’re building this together, one
            feature at a time.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            We take user privacy seriously. TobbiHub does not collect or store any
            personal data beyond what’s necessary for basic analytics. We don’t use
            intrusive tracking cookies or share user data with third-party
            advertisers. Your viewing experience is yours alone — private, secure,
            and ad-free.
          </p>

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            The future of TobbiHub is filled with exciting plans — smarter
            recommendations, personalized watchlists, theme customization, and more.
            As we continue to grow, our focus remains on creating a smooth,
            user-driven platform that celebrates storytelling in all its forms.
          </p>

          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Movies bring people together — families, friends, and strangers across
            the world. They remind us of shared emotions, common struggles, and the
            beauty of imagination. TobbiHub isn’t just about streaming; it’s about
            connecting hearts through stories, one click at a time.
          </p>

          <h2>Final Words</h2>
          <p>
            If you’ve read this far, you’re a true movie lover — and we’re thrilled
            to have you here. Whether you’re binging your favorite series, catching
            up on new releases, or exploring hidden gems, TobbiHub is your home for
            entertainment that feels effortless. Stay tuned — this is just the
